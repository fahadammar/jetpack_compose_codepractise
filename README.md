<strong>What is Jetpack Compose?</strong>
<p align="justify">
The Jetpack Compose. The Compose, through which now the UI is made via I would say direct coding no need of XML.
The learning and practise of Jetpack Compose stuff is here.
</p>

<strong> Jetpack compose is better than XML or not? </strong>
<p align="justify">
When compared to XML, Compose allows you to do more with less code. Compose works intuitively. This means you only need to tell Compose what you want to display to the user. Compose is backwards compatible with all of your existing code: Compose code can be called from Views and Views can be called from Compose.
</p>

<h2> Composable Functions </h2>
<p align="justify">
Jetpack Compose is based on functions that can be combined. Rather than focusing on the process of UI construction, these functions allow you to programmatically define your app's UI by describing how it should look and providing data dependencies (initializing an element, attaching it to a parent, etc.). Simply append the <strong><i>@Composable</i></strong> annotation to the function name to make it composable.
</p>

<h2> Preview your function in Android Studio </h2>
<p align="justify">
The <strong><i>@Preview</i></strong> annotation in Android Studio allows you to preview your composable functions without having to build and install the app on an Android device or emulator.
The annotation needs to be applied to a composable function without parameters. 
</p>

<h2> Layouts </h2>
<p align="justify">
UI elements are hierarchical, with elements within elements. You create a UI hierarchy in Compose by calling composable functions from other composable functions.
</p>
<h3> To Modify or Configure your layout </h3>
<p align="justify">
<strong><i>Compose uses modifiers</i></strong>. They allow you to change the composable's size, layout, appearance or add high-level interactions, such as making an element clickable. You can chain them to create richer composables.
</p>

<h2>Compose is built to support Material Design principles</h2>
<p align="justify">
<strong> Material Design or Material Design Principles,</strong> Compose is built to support Material Design principles. Many of its UI elements implement Material Design out of the box. Material Design is built around three pillars: <code>Color</code>, <code>Typography</code>, and <code>Shape.</code> 
</p>
<h3>Color</h3>
<p>
  Use <code>MaterialTheme.colors</code> to style with colors from the wrapped theme. You can use these values from the theme anywhere a color is needed.
</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>
<p align="justify">
  Material Typography styles are available in the <code>MaterialTheme</code>, just add them to the Text composables.
</p>

<h3>Shape</h3>
<p align="justify">
With Shapeyou can add the final touches.
</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Lists are to say everywhere in the applications, to do so. Use Composeâ€™s <code>LazyColumn</code> and <code>LazyRow</code>
</p>


<h2> Composable Functions Provided By The Compose </h2>

<i>Below are some mentioned Compose Functions that are provided by the Compose.</i>

<ol>
  <li> To show text: <code>Text("hi there")</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    To arrange elements vertically: The <code>Column</code> function lets you arrange elements vertically.
  </li>
  <li>
    To arrange elements horizontally: The <code>Row</code> function lets you arrange elements horizontally.
  </li>
  <li>
    To Add Image: The <code>Image</code> function lets you add the image.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>LazyColumn</code>: The vertically scrolling list that only composes and lays out the currently visible items.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>LazyRow</code>: The horizontally scrolling list that only composes and lays out the currently visible items.
  </li>
</ol>
